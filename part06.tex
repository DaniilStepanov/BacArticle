In this paper we presented an approach to automatic contract mining for use in BMC tools. By embedding the mining problem into the BMC and exploiting the power of modern SMT solvers, our approach is able to extract succinct function contracts. The parametric nature allows one to vary the precision-recall tradeoff on a per-project basis.

We implemented the proposed approach in a prototype plugin for Borealis BMC tool and did some preliminary evaluation. The evaluation results show our approach to be applicable to real software and to improve the~BMC results.

There are several things we would like to consider in our future work. First, we want to do a more extensive and thorough evaluation of our approach, and to also analyze its influence on the quality of BMC results in more detail. Second, we would like to try automating parameter selection via some flavour of computer-aided optimization, and to study their effect on precision and recall. Third, predicate pruning can be amplified to do a more in-depth analysis of unsatisfiable cores, resulting in increased pruning precision. It could also be improved by considering predicates in a per-call-site fashion, thus improving pruning granularity.
